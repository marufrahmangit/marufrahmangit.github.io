# Projects (continued...)

### [Securing Home Office Network Assets](./projects/asset-classification-home-office-network.md)

> This project involves identifying and classifying devices in a home office network. It evaluates each device's access level, owner, and location to determine its sensitivity and required security measures.

### [Risk Assessment and Prioritization in a Commercial Bank](./projects/risk-assessment-risk-register.md)

> This project involves evaluating and prioritizing risks in a commercial bank's operational environment. By assessing the likelihood and severity of each risk, a risk register is developed to guide the cybersecurity team's focus on the most critical vulnerabilities, ensuring the bank's data and assets are well-protected.

### [Data Leak Incident Analysis and Control Implementation](./projects/incident-analysis-data-leak.md)

> This project investigates a data leak incident where internal documents were inadvertently exposed due to inadequate access controls. The analysis identifies the lapse in applying the principle of least privilege and recommends enhancements to prevent similar issues. The project includes a detailed review of NIST SP 800-53: AC-6, focusing on implementing robust access controls and regular privilege audits to secure sensitive information and mitigate data leak risks.
