# Projects (continued...)

### [Controls and Compliance Assessment](./projects/asset-classification-home-office-network.md)

> Conducted an IT audit for Botium Toys, using the NIST CSF to assess risks, evaluate controls, and recommend improvements for enhanced security and regulatory compliance.

### [Securing Home Office Network Assets](./projects/asset-classification-home-office-network.md)

> This project involves identifying and classifying devices in a home office network. It evaluates each device's access level, owner, and location to determine its sensitivity and required security measures.

### [Risk Assessment and Prioritization in a Commercial Bank](./projects/risk-assessment-risk-register.md)

> This project involves evaluating and prioritizing risks in a commercial bank's operational environment. By assessing the likelihood and severity of each risk, a risk register is developed to guide the cybersecurity team's focus on the most critical vulnerabilities, ensuring the bank's data and assets are well-protected.

### [Data Leak Incident Analysis and Control Implementation](./projects/incident-analysis-data-leak.md)

>  Investigated a data leak caused by weak access controls. Identified gaps in least privilege application and recommended improvements. Reviewed NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 to enhance access controls and audit privileges, aiming to secure sensitive information and prevent future leaks.
