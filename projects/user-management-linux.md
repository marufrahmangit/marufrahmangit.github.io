# Add the user to a secondary group
A couple of months later, this employee's role at the organization has changed, and they are working in both the Research and the Sales departments. Add `researcher9` to a secondary group (`sales_team`). Their primary group is still `research_team`.
`sudo usermod -G sales_team researcher9`

# Delete a user
A year later, `researcher9`, decided to leave the company. In this task, you must remove them from the system.
`sudo userdel researcher9`. This removed the user but also prompted a message (yellow line on the screenshot).
`sudo groupdel researcher9`. This deleted the group that is no longer required.
