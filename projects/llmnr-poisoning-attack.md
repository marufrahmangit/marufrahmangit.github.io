# Scenario
The IDS device alerted us to a possible rogue device in the internal Active Directory network. The Intrusion Detection System also indicated signs of LLMNR traffic, which is unusual. It is suspected that an LLMNR poisoning attack occurred. The LLMNR traffic was directed towards Forela-WKstn002, which has the IP address 172.17.79.136. A limited packet capture from the surrounding time is provided to you, our Network Forensics expert. Since this occurred in the Active Directory VLAN, it is suggested that we perform network threat hunting with the Active Directory attack vector in mind, specifically focusing on LLMNR poisoning.

# Goal
- Investigate through network traffic and uncover credential-stealing technique by abusing the LLMNR protocol feature in Windows. 
- Learn how a victim made a typo navigating to a network share and how the attacker was using the Responder tool to steal hashes and pose as a legitimate device in the internal network. 
- Learn to crack NTLMV2 hashes by gathering information from SMB traffic.

# Understanding LLMNR poisoning attack
### What is LLMNR?
LLMNR is a protocol that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local network without requiring a DNS server or DNS configuration.

When a host’s DNS query fails (i.e., the DNS server doesn’t know the name), the host broadcasts an LLMNR request on the local network to see if any other host can answer.

LLMNR is the successor to NetBIOS.  NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is an older protocol that was heavily used in early versions of Windows networking. NBT-NS is a component of NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) and is responsible for name registration and resolution.  Like LLMNR, NBT-NS is a fallback protocol when DNS resolution fails. It allows local name resolution within a LAN.

### How is LLMNR vulnerable?
LLMNR has no authentication mechanism.  Anyone can respond to an LLMNR request, which opens the door to potential attacks.  When a computer tries to resolve a domain name and fails via the standard methods (like DNS), it sends an LLMNR query across the local network.  An attacker can listen for these queries and respond to them, leading to potential unauthorized access.

# Incident Analysis
To find the malicious IP address, first, I identified the IP Address of the domain controller. Any LLMNR requests originating from some other machine to another machine is a sign of a rogue machine pretending to be a Domain controller to capture hashes. I filtered for *UDP port 5355* in wireshark using `"udp.port == 5355"`. This will display all the LLMNR traffic. I found only 1 IP address responding to the victim machine to their query. This IP Address does not belong to the domain controller.

***172.17.79.135***

To find the rougue machine's hostname, I added a filter for the IP address and DHCP in wireshark using `"ip.addr == 172.17.79.135 && dhcp"`. Then I looked for the hostname value in one of the packets. The reason why I used this is because the device used dhcp to get an ip address assigned to itself and map it to its hostname.

Next, I needed to confirm whether the attacker captured the user's hash using the SMB traffic filter in Wireshark using `"smb2"`. Here I found some `ntlmssp negotiate and auth` which means the hash indeed got captured.

To find the username I used the `"ntlmssp"` filter and found the username in `NTLMSSP_AUTH` packets.

To find when the hashes were captured the **First** time, I modified the wireshark view option: `View > Time display format > UTC DATE` to show the time column win UTC format. Then I filtered for `"ntlmssp"` and looked at the the time of the first 3 packets (starting from `NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE` and ending in `NTLMSSP_AUTH` packet).

The typo made by the victim when navigating to the file share caused his credentials to be leaked. When looking at LLMNR traffic I saw that attackers machine responded to a query `"DC01"` which means that the victim typed `DCC01` instead of `DC01` which caused the DNS to fail and the machine to fall back to LLMNR protocol to resolve the query and thats where attackers rogue machine responded to the query pretending to be a domain controller.

***DCC01***

To get the actual credentials of the victim user I needed to stitch together multiple values from the *ntlm negotiation* packets. First, I needed to get the **NTLM server challenge** value. To do so, I added a filter for `ntlmssp`. In details of the `NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE PACKET` (Packet # 9291) I expanded `SMB2` (Server Message Block ProtocolVersion 2) -> Session Setup Response (0x1) -> Security Blob -> GSS-API Generic -> SimpleProtected Negotiation -> negTokenTarg -> NTLM Secure Service Provider -> **NTLM Server Challenge**.

Next, I did something similar to find the `NTProofStr` value. In details of the `NTLMSSP_AUTH` Packet(Packet # 9292) packet details, expand SMB2 (Server Message Block Protocol Version 2) -> Session Setup Response (0x1) -> Security Blob -> GSS-API Generic **** -> Simple Protected Negotiation -> negTokenTarg -> NTLM Secure Service Provider -> -> NTLM Response -> NTLMv2 Response -> **NTProofStr**.

***c0cc803a6d9fb5a9082253a04dbd4cd4***

Next, I tested the password complexity by recovering the password from the information found in packet capture. This is a crucial step as this way we can find whether the attacker was able to crack this and how quickly.

- Created a new file (hashfile.txt) and plugged in the values as follows. `User::Domain:ServerChallenge:NTProofStr:NTLMv2Response(without first 16 bytes/first 32 characters)`. The NTLMv2 Response value is available where we found NTProofStr. Removed the first 16 bytes(32 characters) from the value.

-  Ran hashcat on a password list and the hashfile

- Cracked the hash

***NotMyPassword0K?***

Just to get more context surrounding the incident, I found actual file share that the victim was trying to navigate to by filtering for SMB traffic and scrolled to find a tree connect/disconnect of a NON-DEFAULT File share name.

# Summary

- In LLMNR traffic, look for any machine responding to queries that is not a domain controller.

- Look for NTLM authentication packets going towards the unidentified/unknown machine discovered from point 1.

- Look for typos in LLMNR traffic, DNS traffic, and SMB traffic.

- Try cracking the hash to assess the resilience of the compromised user's password.

- As a follow-up, look for authentications from the compromised user in the environment, particularly after the time of LLMNR poisoning. Focus on logon types three (3) (network logon) and 10 (RDP logon).

# Remediation
If LLMNR and NBT-NS are not required in the environment, they should be disabled entirely as a mitigation measure.

If a particular organization is unable to disable the LLMNR and NBT-NS protocols, they can consider implementing Network Access Control (NAC) and requiring long and complex passwords to reduce the chances of attackers cracking them offline.
