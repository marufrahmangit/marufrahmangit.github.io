# Scenario
Appointment is a web-application box focused on SQL Injection attacks. The target is a website with search functionality vulnerable to `SQL Injection`, querying a back-end `SQL database`. 

Different user privileges return varying search results: administrators can access sensitive data (e.g., user info, billing), while regular users or visitors can only view products. However, an attacker can exploit SQL Injection to bypass these restrictions and query any `table` in the database, accessing information they shouldn't be able to see.

# Enumeration
First, we perform an nmap scan to find the open and available ports and their services. If no alternative flag is specified in the command syntax, nmap will scan the most common 1000 TCP ports for active services. This will suit us in our case.

Additionally, we will need super-user privileges to run the command below with the `-sC` or `-sV` flags. This is because script scanning ( `-sC` ) and version detection ( `-sV` ) are considered more intrusive methods of scanning the target. This results in a higher probability of being caught by a perimeter security device on the target's network.

Only ethernet devices can be used for raw scans on Windows. Use the `--unprivileged` flag for this scan. 

If the host machine "seems" to be down but is really up, but blocking our ping probes we can use the `-Pn` flag.
