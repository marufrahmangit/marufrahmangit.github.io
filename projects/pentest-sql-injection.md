# Scenario
Appointment is a web-application box focused on SQL Injection attacks. The target is a website with search functionality vulnerable to `SQL Injection`, querying a back-end `SQL database`. 

Different user privileges return varying search results: administrators can access sensitive data (e.g., user info, billing), while regular users or visitors can only view products. However, an attacker can exploit SQL Injection to bypass these restrictions and query any `table` in the database, accessing information they shouldn't be able to see.
