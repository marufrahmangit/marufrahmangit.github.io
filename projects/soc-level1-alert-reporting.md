<h1 style="text-align: center;">SOC L1 Alert Reporting</h1>

[Project reference](https://tryhackme.com/room/socl1alertreporting)

# Scenario
During or after alert triage, L1 analysts may be uncertain about how to classify the alert, requiring senior support or information from the system owner. Also, L1 may deal with real cyberattacks and breaches that need immediate attention and remediation actions. This project covers these cases by introducing three new terms: alert reporting, escalation, and communication.

# Tasks
## Investigate the SOC dashboard to find which user email leaked the sensitive document
