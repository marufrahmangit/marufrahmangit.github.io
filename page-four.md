### [Penetration Testing: Exploiting SQL Injection](./projects/pentest-sql-injection.md)

> This project demonstrates how to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in a web application using enumeration techniques, such as Nmap scanning and Gobuster directory brute-forcing, to access sensitive data stored in a back-end SQL database. The target is a website with restricted search functionality, bypassed by leveraging `SQL Injection` to retrieve unauthorized information.
