# Projects (continued...)

### [Penetration Testing: SQL Injection](./projects/pentest-sql-injection.md)

> Conducted a security assessment to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in a web application. Analyzed and documented attack vectors, automated detection using SQLMap, and provided recommendations for securing database queries.

### [System Administration: Installing Metasploit on Ubuntu](./projects/sys-admin-msf-on-ubuntu.md)

> Installing Metasploit framework on Ubuntu 24.04.


### [Penetration Testing: Capturing NetNTLMv2 Hash via File Inclusion Vulnerability in Windows Networks](./projects/pentest-file-inclusion-netntlmv2-active-dir.md)

> This project demonstrates how a File Inclusion vulnerability on a Windows server can be exploited to capture a NetNTLMv2 hash. Using the Responder utility, we collect the challenge hash, then attempt password cracking with John the Ripper. The project also explores NTLM authentication mechanisms, providing foundational knowledge for identifying real-world vulnerabilities that may not be immediately obvious.
