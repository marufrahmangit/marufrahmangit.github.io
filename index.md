# About Me
I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Professional currently building a portfolio as I continue to learn both the GRC and technical aspects of cybersecurity that include (but are not limited to) `Linux` `Python` `SQL` `MariaDB` `SPL` `Splunk` `Wireshark` `Metasploit` `NIST CSF` and `ISO/IEC 27000`.

I have a BSc. degree in Information Technology and have almost a decade of professional experience as a Programmer, Technical Writer, and Project Manager in IT.

### [LLMNR Poisoning Attack Analysis and NTLMv2 Hash Cracking](./projects/llmnr-poisoning-attack.md)

> Conducted network forensics to detect and analyze an LLMNR poisoning attack within Active Directory. Identified a rogue device using Wireshark, traced the attack, and recovered NTLMv2 hashes, showcasing techniques for detecting credential theft and password cracking with Hashcat.

### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis on SSH Brute-Force Attack](./projects/brute-force-attack.md)

> Investigated a compromised Confluence server by analyzing Unix auth.log and wtmp logs to pinpoint the attackerâ€™s IP, track unauthorized access, and uncover persistence methods. Identified privilege escalation, a backdoor account, and malicious script execution, correlating with MITRE ATT&CK sub-techniques.

### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis of Kerberoasting Attack](./projects/kerberoasting-attack.md)

> Analyzed domain controller security logs, PowerShell logs, and prefetch files to confirm the Kerberoasting attack's timeline, targeted services, and tools. Provided insights into Active Directory enumeration and credential dumping activities.

### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis of ASREP Roasting Attack](./projects/asrep-roasting-attack.md)

> Investigated Windows event logs to detect ASREP Roasting and Kerberoasting attacks. Identified the attack timeline, targeted accounts, and IP addresses of compromised assets, focusing on key event IDs and attributes to support incident response and containment efforts.

### [Incident Report and Response Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework](./projects/incident-report-nist-csf.md)

> This project involves analyzing a DDoS attack on a multimedia company using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The report covers incident identification, protection measures, detection improvements, response strategies, and recovery steps to enhance the company's network security and prevent future attacks.
