# Overview
I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Professional currently building a portfolio as I continue to learn both the GRC and technical aspects of cybersecurity that includes but are not limited to `Linux` `Python` `SQL` `MariaDB` `Snort` `Splunk` `Wireshark` `Metasploit` `NIST CSF` and `ISO/IEC 27000`.

I have a BSc. degree in Information Technology and have close to a **decade of professional experience** as a Programmer, Technical Writer, and a Project Manager in IT.

# Projects

## Security Operations Center (SOC)
### [LLMNR Poisoning Attack Analysis and NTLMv2 Hash Cracking](./projects/llmnr-poisoning-attack.md)

> Conducted network forensics to detect and analyze an LLMNR poisoning attack within Active Directory. Identified a rogue device using Wireshark, traced the attack, and recovered NTLMv2 hashes, showcasing techniques for detecting credential theft and password cracking with Hashcat.

## Data Forensic and Incident Response
### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis on SSH Brute-Force Attack](./projects/brute-force-attack.md)

> Investigated a compromised Confluence server by analyzing Unix auth.log and wtmp logs to pinpoint the attackerâ€™s IP, track unauthorized access, and uncover persistence methods. Identified privilege escalation, a backdoor account, and malicious script execution, correlating with MITRE ATT&CK sub-techniques.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
