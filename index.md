# About Me
I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Professional currently building a portfolio as I continue to learn both the GRC and technical aspects of cybersecurity that include (but are not limited to) `Linux` `Python` `SQL` `MariaDB` `SPL` `Splunk` `Wireshark` `Metasploit` `NIST CSF` and `ISO/IEC 27000`.

I have a BSc. degree in Information Technology and have almost a decade of professional experience as a Programmer, Technical Writer, and Project Manager in IT.

### [Penetration Testing: Exploiting SQL Injection](./projects/pentest-sql-injection.md)

> This project demonstrates how to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities in a web application using enumeration techniques, such as Nmap scanning and Gobuster directory brute-forcing, to access sensitive data stored in a back-end SQL database. The target is a website with restricted search functionality, bypassed by leveraging `SQL Injection` to retrieve unauthorized information.

### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis of LLMNR Poisoning Attack and NTLMv2 Hash Cracking](./projects/llmnr-poisoning-attack.md)

> Conducted network forensics to detect and analyze an LLMNR poisoning attack within Active Directory. Identified a rogue device using Wireshark, traced the attack, and recovered NTLMv2 hashes, showcasing techniques for detecting credential theft and password cracking with Hashcat.

### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis of Kerberoasting Attack](./projects/kerberoasting-attack.md)

> Analyzed domain controller security logs, PowerShell logs, and prefetch files to confirm the Kerberoasting attack's timeline, targeted services, and tools. Provided insights into Active Directory enumeration and credential dumping activities.

### [Incident Report and Response Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework](./projects/incident-report-nist-csf.md)

> This project involves analyzing a DDoS attack on a multimedia company using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The report covers incident identification, protection measures, detection improvements, response strategies, and recovery steps to enhance the company's network security and prevent future attacks.
