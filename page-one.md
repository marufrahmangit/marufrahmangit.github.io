# Projects

### [LLMNR Poisoning Attack Analysis and NTLMv2 Hash Cracking](./projects/llmnr-poisoning-attack.md)

> Conducted network forensics to detect and analyze an LLMNR poisoning attack within Active Directory. Identified a rogue device using Wireshark, traced the attack, and recovered NTLMv2 hashes, showcasing techniques for detecting credential theft and password cracking with Hashcat.

### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis on SSH Brute-Force Attack](./projects/brute-force-attack.md)

> Investigated a compromised Confluence server by analyzing Unix auth.log and wtmp logs to pinpoint the attacker’s IP, track unauthorized access, and uncover persistence methods. Identified privilege escalation, a backdoor account, and malicious script execution, correlating with MITRE ATT&CK sub-techniques.

### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis of Kerberoasting Attack](./projects/kerberoasting-attack.md)

> Analyzed domain controller security logs, PowerShell logs, and prefetch files to confirm the Kerberoasting attack's timeline, targeted services, and tools. Provided insights into Active Directory enumeration and credential dumping activities.

### [Incident Response and Forensic Analysis of ASREP Roasting Attack](./projects/asrep-roasting-attack.md)

> Investigated Windows event logs to detect ASREP Roasting and Kerberoasting attacks. Identified the attack timeline, targeted accounts, and IP addresses of compromised assets, focusing on key event IDs and attributes to support incident response and containment efforts.

### [Incident Report Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework](./projects/incident-report-nist-csf.md)

> Analyzed a DDoS attack on a multimedia company, applying the NIST CSF to improve network security. Identified vulnerabilities, implemented protective measures including firewall rules and IDS/IPS systems, enhanced detection with monitoring and IP verification, and developed response strategies. Established recovery protocols to restore services and prevent future attacks.
